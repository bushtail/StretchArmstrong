# StretchArmstrong [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/N4N21JQB0)

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studiio, Inc.

It allows the user to modify their interaction distance.

I made this mod because I couldn't reach some cobwebs when I was using the clutter removal portion of [Better Bases by Xpazeman](https://github.com/Xpazeman/tld-better-bases/releases).
